Why must we always chose between certain death and probable death?

That's what Clank said the last time I tried to kill our enemies with a wrench instead of a rocket launcher... I don't get it, the boomerang wrench is a pretty good weapon!

[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]That was a fun mod to create ^^ Making that damn [strike]G2[/strike] Clank behave correctly was a pain in the ***, but I finally made it after changing the properties of the robot again and again X) The base of it was the Rudolph Goat (with it's riding mechanism), but I had to change a lot of things to remove completely collisions on the robot and avoid glitchy behaviours ^^
Then I started working on the wrench. Basically, a copy of the laser sword (from Hero Goat), but spinnig and not dissapearing after one hit ^^ Because fo that I had to adjust the damages of the wrench in the MMO and GoatZ to have it kind of balanced compared to your headbutt damages.
There was another ability request which was a dancing globe (as in the last R&C game), but I didn't add it for now as this is not something present in all versions of the game, and some other mutator (Deadgoa7) already provide a power really close to that :)
